# BöbDeck
A custom cyberdeck based around the RPi CM4, specifically the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 Lite WiFi 4GB (SC0671 or CM4104000).

## Inspiration
I decided one time that I wanted to make a custom cyberdeck around the RPi CM4, why exactly? I don't know. But what I do know is that I got the inspiration to make this when I started watching some Jeff Geerling videos about the CM4 on YouTube. And then I saw the **[BIGTREETECH Raspberry Pad 5](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-raspberry-pad-5)**, which inspired the design and features of this cyberdeck. Now, I would buy the Pad 5 but it didn't have support for a battery, the screen was too small and most importantly, the cables are not on the same side. Now I know that is not really possible with a 5" screen, but I would like to have a laptop looking cyberdeck. And that's why I want all the cables on two sides, right and left. And all of that inspired me to make this cyberdeck, BöbDeck.

## Files
I am soon done with the schematics and I will soon upload them in **[hardware/schematic/](hardware/schematic/)**. I will also upload the PCB designs in **[hardware/pcb/](hardware/pcb/)**. All of the KiCad files will be available in **[hardware/kicad/](hardware/kicad/)**.
