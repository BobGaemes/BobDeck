# BÃ¶bDeck
A custom cyberdeck based around the RPi CM4, specifically the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 Lite WiFi 4GB (SC0671 or CM4104000).

# Inspiration
I decided one time that I wanted to make a custom cyberdeck around the RPi CM4, why exactly? I don't know. But what I do know is that I am soon done with the schematics and I will soon upload them in **[hardware/schematic/](hardware/schematic/)** and I will also upload the PCB designs in **[hardware/pcb/](hardware/pcb/)**. I got the inspiration to make this when I started watching some Jeff Geerling videos about the CM4 on YouTube. And then I saw the **[BIGTREETECH Raspberry Pad 5](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-raspberry-pad-5)**, which inspired me to make this cyberdeck.
